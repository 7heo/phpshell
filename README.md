PHPShell
========
A dropin shell in PHP

How to
------
Just put this file in a world-readable directory to give the world a shell access to your server with the user that runs the PHP engine.

Notes
-----
Please read the *How to* and understand that world means **world**. If you use this, it probably is a **good idea to secure this script** (htaccess, etc.) so only you can execute it.
